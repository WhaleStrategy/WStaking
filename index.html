## 🔑 Staking Duration & APR Calculation

<div align="center">

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>📅 Duration</strong></th>
      <th><strong>📈 APR Range</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1 Month</td>
      <td><strong>🔹 10%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 Months</td>
      <td><strong>🔸 12% – 15%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6 Months</td>
      <td><strong>🟠 15% – 24%</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>12 Months</td>
      <td><strong>🟢 24% – 36%</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

</div>

* 💡 Stakes of **10 USDT or more** qualify for at least **10% APR**
* 📊 APR **increases progressively** with your stake amount
* 🏆 Maximum APR is unlocked at **10,000 USDT or more**

---

## ➕ Additional Staking Rules

* **Different durations cannot be combined**
* **Same durations can be added**, and the **entire stake period resets**
* This ensures fair APR calculation and consistent reward logic

---

## 🔁 Automatic Renewal

When your selected staking duration ends:

* Your stake **automatically renews** for the same duration
* Rewards will **recalculate and resume** during the renewed period
* **You can unstake anytime** after renewal **without penalty**
* Note: **Promotional APR** applies only during the original locked period

---

## 🚫 Early Unstake & Withdrawal Policy

* **Unstaking before the end of the duration** incurs a **10% penalty**
* **Unstake withdrawals** take **7–10 days** to return to your wallet
* During this time, assets remain in trading execution – **to avoid holding loss**, avoid unnecessary unstaking
